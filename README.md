# Drinks project
This is a simple practice project. My main goal with this project is practice using React.js.

## The application 
The application itself is a single page app where the user can search for drink recipes. 

## The application structure 
The application was made using React.js. It has a few components and It is using a free API <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php">TheCocktailDB</a> to fetch the content needed.

## Challenges 
While developing this project, I could practice how to work with an API and an async function. I also created components, used props and thought about the user interface that I would like to apply to the page.
