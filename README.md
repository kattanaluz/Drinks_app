Web page where the user can find cocktails recipes by cocktail name. There are still sections where the user can find a monthly selected cocktail, browse a selection of spirits, or get a random drink.

Link to the live page [here](https://drink-recipes-finder.netlify.app/).

## The application structure

The application was built using React.js. It has a couple components and it is using the free API [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to fetch the content needed.

The page was styled using CSS

## Process and Challenges

The main goal of this project was to gain practice creating an application from scratch using React.js.

While developing this project, I could work with an API and practice handling async functions. I also implemented multiple routes using React Router package.

Since the first start of the project, I have been using Netlifly to deploy the application following the CI/CD methodology.

The UI was designed to allow the user to navigate using shortcuts and to provide informative feedback. The design is fully responsive and was created using CSS.
