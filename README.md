# Drink Recipes Project

It is a simple practice project. My main goal with this project is to practice using React.js, deployment, and CSS.

## The application

The project is a single-page app where users can search for drink recipes.

## The application structure

The application was built using React.js. It has a few components and It is using a free API <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php">TheCocktailDB</a> to fetch the content needed.

## Challenges

While developing this project, I could practice working with an API, dealing with async function, and build a website using React from scratch. I also designed the UI and applied all CSS needed to make the page responsive.
